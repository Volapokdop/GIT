Life, it seems, be fade away.
Drifting further every day.
Getting lost within myself,
Nothing matter, no one else.
I have lost the will to live,
Simply nothing more to give.
There is nothing more for me,
Need the end to set me free.
Words are not what use to be,
Missing one inside of me.
Deathly lost, this can't be real.
Cannot stand in hell i feel.
Emptiness is feeling me 
To the point of agony.
Drawing darkness taking down,
I was me, but no he's gone.
No one but me can save myself, but is to late.
Now i cant thins, think why i shoud even try.
Yesterday seems as it was never existed.
Death greats me wars, now i want just say goodbye.
Goodbye.
